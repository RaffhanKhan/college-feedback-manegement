# college-feedback-manegement

The purpose of this project is to make the process of taking feedback from the  students in online regarding the lecturer's teaching. As this is the online-era,where  everything is online we need to develop a system in online which is very useful to  maintain feedback reports by the administrator. With this, the institutes can access  the feedback reports in a faster way and without any loss of data. As of now this  task was done Manually with these of papers and pens. This has many drawbacks  and evaluating this hand written form is a difficult process. 
Student needs to logging into the website of online feedback system and giving  his/her feedback. With this the student can successfully submit feedback on lecturer's  teaching in a very efficient manner without any loss of data. The administrator and  the faculty members can access these feedbacks from the students and take  appropriate actions.
